### Quick start guide

### Secrets

Get API keys at https://console.developers.google.com & https://darksky.net/dev/
and add them to the server secrets.

```bash
npm install
export google=<your value here>
export darksky=<your value here>
npm start
```


### App secrets

This pad contains some secret keys which you will need to provide as environment variables in order to run it locally (the secret values have been removed for your security). Secret values are often used for things like database passwords and private cryptographic keys.

Here is a list of the secrets in this project for which you will need to provide values: google, darksky.

You can set them by exporting them as environment variables in your shell:

```sh
export google=<your value here>
export darksky=<your value here>
```
